* Prediction only for display
* Category might be helpful to use one trained model for a fast switch of models in case of street light condition changes
* if used in combination with classification, it might be possible to react

* Training requires less images
* Detection of direction is more stable than using jetbot road following training
* Speed up to 0.8, while increasing steering gain and kD

# Object following according category
* Object following is more stable and fast
